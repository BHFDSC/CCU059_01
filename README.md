## Project description

The annual winter season poses substantial challenges to the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Hospitalisation and mortality increase during winter, especially in people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC or multimorbidity). We aimed to describe which combinations of long-term conditions (LTC) are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation or death during winter 2021-22 (the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic) amongst adults in England.
